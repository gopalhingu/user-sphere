## Environment Configuration

Before running the application, make sure to configure your `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID='your-google-client-id'
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET='your-google-client-secret'
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI='http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/google/callback'

JWT_SECRET=your-generated-jwt-secret
L5_SWAGGER_CONST_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:8000
L5_SWAGGER_GENERATE_ALWAYS=true
```

- Replace `'your-google-client-id'` and `'your-google-client-secret'` with your Google OAuth credentials.
- The `JWT_SECRET` can be generated using the command `php artisan jwt:secret`.
- `L5_SWAGGER_CONST_HOST` should point to your application URL.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have properly configured your `.env` file with the correct database credentials before running the migration.
- You may need to set up additional environment variables, such as `APP_URL` and `APP_KEY`, based on your deployment setup.
